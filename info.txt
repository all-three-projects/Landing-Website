All faq questions below. Divided into different categories

Edu Loan

Q1. Who is eligible for an education loan?
Any student with an admission offer letter from a recognized university abroad. One of the parents and working siblings can act as co-applicants.

Q2. What is a collateral-free loan?
A collateral-free loan is one where you don’t need to pledge property or any assets. Many banks/NBFCs offer up to ₹7.5–40 lakh (depending on profile & country) without collateral. This is provided to student going to pursue a master’s degree.

Q3. How much loan amount can I get?
It depends on your course, country, and family’s financial profile. Amounts can go higher upto ₹1.5 crore.

Q4. When do I start repaying the loan?
Most lenders give a moratorium period (course duration plus 6–12 months). You are usually allowed to pay simple interest or partial EMI during study, and full EMIs start after the moratorium period

Q5. What expenses are covered by an education loan?
Tuition fees, living expenses, travel, insurance, exam fees, and other expenses like laptops/study material.

Q6. What is the interest rate on study abroad loans?
It varies between 9%–13% for Indian banks and can be slightly higher with NBFCs. Rate depends on loan type, collateral, and co-applicant profile.

Q7. Who can be a co-applicant for my loan?
Usually parents, guardians, or blood relatives. Some NBFCs allow working siblings too.

Q8. Do I need to pay interest while studying?
Most banks allow complete deferment till the moratorium period. But, paying partially during study helps reduce overall burden.

Q9. Can I get a loan without income proof of my parents?
It’s difficult with banks, but NBFCs may consider stronger student profiles (good universities, STEM courses) even with limited parental income as low as INR 3 Lakh annually.

Q11. Can I transfer my loan to another bank later?
Yes, through loan refinancing if you find lower interest rates.

Q12. Do I need a guarantor for my education loan?
Yes, most lenders require a co-applicant or guarantor. In some cases, collateral substitutes for guarantor requirements.

Q13. Can I get an education loan for diploma or certificate programs?
Loans are usually approved for UG, PG, MBA, MBBS, STEM, and professional courses. Short diplomas may not qualify unless from a reputed institute.
Q14. Do I need to pay interest on the full loan amount sanctioned, or only what I use?
You only pay interest on the amount you actually use, not on the total loan sanctioned. It works like an overdraft facility.
Example: If you are approved for ₹50 lakhs but withdraw only ₹15 lakhs for tuition and living expenses, your EMI and interest will be calculated only on ₹15 lakhs, not on the remaining ₹35 lakhs.


🎓 Admissions & Courses

1. What are the eligibility requirements for studying abroad?
Requirements vary by country and university, but generally you need your academic transcripts, English proficiency proof (IELTS/PTE/MOI), and financial documents. Don’t worry, we’ll check your profile first and suggest only the right-fit options.

2. What if my percentage/CGPA is low, can I still get admission abroad?
Yes. Many universities accept students with average scores, especially if you have strong motivation, work experience, or a clear career plan. We’ll help you find universities that value more than just grades.

3. Do gap years or backlogs reduce my chances?
Not necessarily. Some countries/universities are flexible with gaps and backlogs if you can justify them. We’ll guide you on how to present your case honestly and which countries/universities shall be the best fit.

4. If I don’t have IELTS, what options do I still have?
You can apply through MOI (Medium of Instruction), or choose universities/countries that don’t require IELTS/PTE. We can shortlist such options for you.

5. Can I change my course or university after applying?
Yes, in most cases before visa filing. After visa, you may need to reapply depending on the country’s rules.

6. Can I apply to multiple universities at the same time?
Yes, and it’s often smart to keep 3 countries as backup. When you start your process with us, we’ll apply to 3 universities for you.

💰 Finances & Transparency

7. How much does it cost to study abroad (tuition + living)?
It depends on country and course. A tentative breakdown:
	•	UK: ₹20–30 lakh/year
	•	Canada: ₹15–25 lakh/year
	•	Europe: ₹8–18 lakh/year
We’ll give you a detailed cost breakdown before you commit.

8. Do I need to show bank balance for student visa? How much?
Yes, most countries require proof of funds for 1 year’s tuition + living.
We’ll tell you the exact figure for your case.

9. Can I apply for education loans without collateral?
Yes. Many Indian banks and NBFCs offer unsecured loans up to ₹40 lakh for master’s programs. We’ll connect you to the right lender.

10. What if my loan doesn’t get approved in time?
We can suggest backup lenders or guide you for partial payment options. The key is starting early, we’ll help you plan the timeline.

11. Do you take money in advance or only after admission?
We don’t take any third-party fees. All payments (university, exam, visa) are made directly from your account. We only charge our service fee at visa filing.

Q. What are third-party fees, and where does my money go?
Third-party fees are expenses you pay directly to official organizations, never to us. These usually begin once you start your university or visa application. Examples include:
	•	University application fees — Some universities charge ₹3,000–₹8,000 per application, while others don’t charge any at all.
	•	VFS or Visa Application Centre fees — Paid for submitting biometrics and documents.
	•	Embassy visa fees — Official charges by the destination country’s embassy/consulate.
	•	Medical tests & health checks — Required by some countries before visa approval.
	•	GIC deposit (Canada) — A blocked account of CAD 10,000 required to prove living expenses.
	•	Blocked account (Germany) — Approx. €11,208 required for a year’s living costs.
	•	Mandatory health/travel insurance — Country-specific, e.g., Germany requires insurance before visa issuance.
	•	Accommodation deposits — Advance payment for hostel/university housing or private rentals.

12. What happens if my visa gets rejected — do I lose my money?
University fees are refundable, but the institutes deduct certain amount for different procedural things which usually amounts between INR 10k- 50k. If a rejection happens, we’ll guide you on reapplying or alternative options.

⸻

🌍 Visa & Travel

13. How soon should I apply for a visa before my intake?
Apply at least  2 months before your intake. For popular countries, earlier is better since slots fill up quickly.

14. Do you also guide for dependent/spouse visas?
Yes. Many students travel with their spouse/children, and we provide full guidance for dependent visa applications.

Q. Do you guarantee 100% visa success?
No one can guarantee a visa, as the final decision rests with the embassy or consulate. However, over time, we’ve discovered key steps that consistently maximize your chances:
Show financial stability with a small education loan – Even a loan as low as ₹5 lakh signals seriousness and ability to fund your studies. It also acts as a guarantor, showing the embassy that you are financially accountable to come back and likely to comply with visa rules.
Prepare a clean, consistent document set – Ensure every certificate, bank statement, and form matches your profile. Small inconsistencies can delay or jeopardize approval.
Master the visa interview with insider insights – Present your study plan logically, answer typical questions confidently, and highlight your career goals clearly.

By following these steps, our students consistently achieve high approval rates, giving you the best possible chance without false guarantees.

📚 Test Prep & Learning

22. How much time do I need to prepare for IELTS/PTE?
On average 4–8 weeks, depending on your English level.

23. What if I fail in the first attempt — do you re-train me?
Yes. We provide continued training, mocks, and feedback until you clear with your target score.

24. Do you give practice papers or standard mocks?
We give a mix — official-style mocks + practice based on the latest trends and student feedback.

25. Is test prep included in your admission package, or separate?
It’s separate, since not everyone needs test prep. 

Q. Is test preparation included in your services, or is it paid separately?
Test preparation (IELTS, TOEFL, GRE, GMAT, etc.) is a separate paid service. We guide you on which test is needed for your target country/university, but the actual coaching or online prep courses are chargeable. This way, you only pay if you actually need the training.

⸻

Q. Do you charge for SOP (Statement of Purpose) writing?
We provide free SOP samples and also offer a free evaluation of your draft, so you can improve it yourself. However, if you want our team to write your SOP professionally from scratch, it is a paid service. This ensures students who are confident in writing don’t have to pay, while those who prefer expert help can opt-in.
